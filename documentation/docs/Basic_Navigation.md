# Basic Navigation 

## Overview
ProteoVision is operated via the main Navigation panel for selection/filtering and contains three main applets: i) Alignment Viewer for representation of multiple sequence alignments; ii) PDB topology Viewer for depiction of protein secondary structures; iii) MolStar viewer for visualization of three-dimensional structures. Additionally, non-mappable statistical data (e.g. amino acids frequencies) are visualized in a separate window using Plotly applet. Detailed description of all functions for ProteoVision is listed below. ProteoVision also contains an optional interactive guided tour with a brief description of each functional element.
